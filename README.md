# Massive_MIMO
Study the impact of number of antennas on energy and spectral efficiency of large multiuser MIMO systems.

## Compared the system performance of maximal ratio combining (MRC), zero forcing (ZF) receivers.
## MATLAB simulation for the cases of perfect and imperfect channel state information.
